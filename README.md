# Picycle

What happens when you take a bicycle and attach a Raspberry Pi to it? A picycle! It's a POC that utilizes a few off-the-shelf sensors along with some nifty 3D-printed mounts to enable the creation of GPX files while riding. GPX files are a common format used by many applications to represent tracks, routes, and waypoints gather through GPS.

Q: There are many apps available on smartphones that do this better, so why picycle?

A: First and foremost, it's a fun POC. Don't expect picycle to provide better accuracy or features over it's smartphone competitors. Better user-controls while riding is the _only_ notable advantage.
